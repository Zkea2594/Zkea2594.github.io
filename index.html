            <p>
                I'm a Game Designer with experience in Unreal Engine. I love creating cooperative games that push players to analyze and think.
                I also like to challenge myself and innovate ways to turn one idea into my own. I'm currently an Online Game Design Student at Full Sail University.
                I'm based out of Washington State. I love it here and I have hopes of opening my own studio based here out of Washington.

            <h3>Blockmesh Level Design</h3>
            <p>
                Here is my latest blockmesh design. I wanted to protray more of a greek/mediterranian theme for the setting. I also wanted to convey more movement to add a sense of direction.
                Utilizing carts and lights to simulate breadcrumbs for the player to follow. Providing an aqueduct to give the player a direction to look where water is flowing from. Add in birds circling overhead to signify a sense of importance.
                Further in the player comes across a gated path. I utilized trees to lead the way and climbable surfaces to give the player  sense of resistance. Later on the player is forced to cross a gap without a safe way to return.
                This creates a valve barring the player until a later condition is met. Upon reaching the temple, a gorgeous view of the city is available, and the door is interactable. With the door I wanted to symbolize the heaviness of the doors and made them move slowly.

                This is part of a group project between 3 classmates. Each of us focusing on different aspects.
                I'm playing around with Procedurally Generated level designs and when completed it will create levels with various objectives ensuring different playthroughs each time.'
